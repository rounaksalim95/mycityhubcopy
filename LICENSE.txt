To avoid big license headers in small source files the Unique License Identifiers as defined by the Linux Foundation's SPDX project [1]
(AKA SPDX Identifiers) are used in this project.
 
The corresponding license texts can be found in a file which filename is the Unique License Identifier with the extension txt, low-case.
For example, the text of the so-called "2-Clause simplified BSD" license will be found in a file called "bsd-2-clause.txt" either at the
top-directory or in a directory called "licenses". The license that applies to each file will be specified this form in the header of each file:
 
SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-2-clause
 
We use the SPDX Unique License Identifiers here; these are available at [2].
